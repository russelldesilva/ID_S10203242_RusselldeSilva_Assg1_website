ID Assignment 1
This website is a personal portfolio website for myself. Its user audience would be future job recruiters looking to hire me to their company.

The website will serve as an exhibition of the various projects and achievements I have completed or earned throughout my schooling life. It will also highlight my education and work experience, which will be useful for job recruiters viewing my website.
It should be readable and easy-to-navigate to ensure users have a good experience while browsing.

Design Process
This website is for myself. Its aim is to present myself in the best light for the user audience to hire me. As I would like make a career in the IT sector in the future, a website would be a great way to display my IT skills as well as allow the hiring recruiters to know more about me. It allows me to include all my projects and achievements in a format that is easily accessible by anyone, and enables me to express my creativity
